# write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
# how would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer was not allowed?

# return kth to last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list

# delete middle node: Implement an algo to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node

# partition: write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such
# that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x
# if x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after
# the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"
# it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions

# sum lists: you have 2 nums represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
# the digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. write a
# func that adds the 2 nums and returns the sum as a linked list

# palindrome: implement a func to check if a linked list is a palindrome

# intersection: given 2 singly linked lists, determine if the 2 intersect
# return the intersecting node - note that intersection is based on reference, not value
# if the kth node of the 2st linked list is the same exact node as the jth node of the 2nd
# linked list, they are intersecting

# loop detection: given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beg of the loop
